          # which work correctly because:
          # 1. Primary deployment: Custom domain (ffcworkingsite1.org via CNAME file) - root paths work
          # 2. GitHub Pages subpath deployment would require path rewriting, but custom domain takes precedence
          #
          # The CI workflow still builds and tests the Next.js version for development validation,
          # but this deploy workflow uses the pre-built HTML for production.
