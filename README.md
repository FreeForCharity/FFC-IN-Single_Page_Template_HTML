- **Custom Domain**: Configured via `CNAME` file in `html-site/` directory
- **No Build Step**: Pure HTML files are served directly from the `html-site/` directory

## Local Development

No build process or dependencies required! Simply open the HTML files in your browser:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/FreeForCharity/FFC-IN-Single_Page_Template_HTML.git
cd FFC-IN-Single_Page_Template_HTML

# Open in browser
cd html-site
open index.html  # macOS
# or
xdg-open index.html  # Linux
# or just double-click index.html in Windows
```

### Using a Local HTTP Server (Optional)

For testing features that require a web server (like cookies or CORS):

```bash
# Using Python (usually pre-installed)
cd html-site
python3 -m http.server 8000
# Visit http://localhost:8000

# Or using PHP (if installed)
cd html-site
php -S localhost:8000

# Or using Node.js http-server (if you have Node installed)
npx http-server html-site -p 8000
```

---

## Testing

The repository includes Playwright E2E tests to validate HTML site functionality:

```bash
# Install dependencies (first time only)
npm install

# Run all tests

npm run test:headed
```

Tests validate:
